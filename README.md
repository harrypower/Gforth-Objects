# Gforth-Objects
Gforth tools written with objects.fs dependancy.  Can be used where Gforth is used!

stringobj.fs  This is a string and a strings object.  String object will create
and manipulation of a string.  Strings object will create an array of string
to manipulate.  Strings object uses string object internally.  All memory is managed
and the heap is used.  Some method names are similar to the Gforth internal string
words but are not the same as them so should not give compiler errors.
